[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bennofs/vplan-utils.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bennofs/vplan-utils)

This is work-in-progress. The API may still change, especially Core.Schedule.

Currently, this project only works with GHC 7.6. It does NOT work if you compile with GHC 7.4.

Status:
  - Implementation of Schedule nearly finished
  - Fetching the cover table from http://manos-dresden.org/ works
